#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is defined as the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.

- Software engineering is important to the technology industry because it plays a crucial role in enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.


Identify and describe atleast three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- The first one is obviously the development of programming languages and then followed by the establishement of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, subsequented by the long awaited arrival of structured engineering as a discipline in the 1970s and the rise of agile methodologies, which use an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- The Software Development Life Cycle has several phases, namely;
- Requirements; in this phase the system requirements are gathered and documented.
- Design; in this phase high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface are created or rather designed.
- Implemetation; in this phase the writing of the code for the software and the building of said software according to the design specifications occur.
- Testing; this is where several test are conducted on the software to ensure that the software meets quality standards and functional requirements that were gathered in the requirements phase.
- Deployment: After the software passes all the tests, it is then released to  users and customers.
- Maintenance; the final phase exists to keep the software running through ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after it has been deployed. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- The Waterfall methodology uses a sequential approach to development with distinct phases that subsequent each other like a "waterfall", such as the Software Development Life Cycle (SLDC). In manufacturing, a scenario such as setting up a new production line, would require the Waterfall method since the involved are often sequential and precisely defined, from the design stage to the final product stage. Whilst the Agile methodology uses an iterative and incremental approach focused on felxibility, collaboration and resposding to change. The maintenance and provision of software updates for a newly developed software system serves as an example for a scenario that would be appropriate use for the Agile methodology.
- The difference or rather the contrast is the fact that traditionally the Waterfall methodology uses mainly a linear approach whilst the Agile methodology uses a modern, iterative approach.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- A software developer's main roles and responsibilities in a software team are to write the code and to develop the software solutions for the system/program is working on. 
- A quality assurance engineer is responsible for ensuring the quality of the software by designing and executing test plans.
- A project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
  

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), such as; Visual Studio, NetBeans, PyCharm, CodeBlocks, etc. enhace developer productivity and code quality. IDEs provide real time error detection and code analysis, therefore helping developers identify and fix issues early in the development cycle. IDEs also also debugging tools that enable developers to step through their code, inspect variables and pinpoint the root causes of pontential bugs.
-  Version Control Systems (VCS), such as; Git, Mercurial, AWS CodeCommit, GitLab, etc. facilitate teamwork by allowing code sharing, merging and conflict resolution, promoting teamwork and collaboration, code managemnet  and project stability. Version Control Systems also have the ability to record every change to the codebase, hence providing a log for the history of the evolution of the project, this is important since it allows developers to be able to track any modifications made to the prpject, revert to previous versions and identify bugs.
- In essence they are important to the software development process because they enhance productivity, collaboration and code quality. Together theey form a powerful combination that is essential for efficient and effective software development.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Tight deadlines; the pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality and, in some ocassions, the developer feeling burnt out. A strategy to overcome this would be to firstly utilize time management techniques such as the Pomodoro technique. Another thing the software engineer could do is prioritze a work-life balance by setting boudaries and taking breaks. Implementing these strategies could improve productivity and ensure projects are delivered on schedule.
- Changing requirements; During the development cycle, the customer might request more changes to project therefore resulting in delays in the delivery of the project. Effective and timely communication between the software engineers and the customer could prove to be strategy that can overcome this. Another strategy that can be implemented is having regular meetings to reassess the project goals and timelines during the development cycle, so as to avoid any unwanted delays or confusion.
- Another challenge is ensuring scalability; this means that as the applications/system grows software engineers have the responsibility of ensuring that software can handle the increase in data and traffic. To overcome this, software engineers can utilize cloud computing services to easily scale resources and conduct regular performance testing to identify potential bugs or if the software needs any improvement. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit testing refers to testing individual components or modules of software in isolation, in order to verify that each component performs its intended task correctly. It is important because it promotes early detection of bugs, the sooner bugs and erros are discovered the cheaper and easier they are to fix, therefore encouraging code reliability which is essential for quality assurance. Unit testing also facilitates code refactoring, this gives developers a safety net and the confidence to refactor their code.
- Integration testing refers to testing the interactions between different components or subsystems, this means it examines how the different modules of code interact with each other. It verifies that the interface between components work correctly and that data flows smoothly. It is important to quality assurance in software because it ensures that the connections between parts of the system are working as intended.
- System testing is the evaluates the entire completed system as a whole, including all its components and interfaces against the specified requirements, this is done to verify that the system meets its overall requirements. This is important, as it ensures that the entire system functions correctly from start to finish and it assesses the overall quality and stability of the system which is integral in the assurance of software quality.
- Acceptance testing determines whether the system meets the end-users needs and expectations, this means the software is tested against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs, it is often performed by end-users or stakeholders. Acceptance testing is important in software quality assurance because it ensures that the software meets the users requirments and is usable, it also confirms that the software meets the businesses objective and provides the final validation before the software is released to the public.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- In simple terms prompt engineering is defined as giving clear instructions to AI models in oder to get the best possible response.
- Prompt engineering is important in interacting with AI models because it helps AI understand exactly what you need from it and therefore give a fitting answer.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- vague prompt: tell me about democracy and apartheid
- improved prompt: tell me about the events that happened during apartheid in South Africa that led to it finally becoming a democratric nation.
- the improved prompt is more effective because it has context and very descriptive therefore making it clear and specific. It also has keywords (South Africa, democracy), which will help guide the AI model towards the response im looking for.
